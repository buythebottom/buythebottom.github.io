<h1>Buy the Bottom</h1>

<p>My Trading Blog on the Base Chain.</p>


<h2>The Premise & Strategy:</h2>

<p>Here's the theory. People who make good money who trade volatile cryptocurrencies short-term either buy once a token comes out or they buy the bottom of a good token that bounces back up.</p>
<p>Since 99% of coins are scams on base, it's hard to find a good project and be early.</p>
<p>Also, once a token is released, you can't get its information on https://de.fi/scanner/ to see if its legit, only after like 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So if you buy a coin once it comes out, you may realize you can't sell it, because they coded the token in a way where only whitelisted addresses are allowed to sell.</p>
<p>Or you get rugpulled.</p>
<p>Or if the token is legit, the presalers dump on you once the price rises on the first day.</p>
<p>All of this is BS!</p>
<p>That's why we go for a different strategy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Find a good legit token:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Good score on de.fi/scanner and good rating on dexscreener</li>
		<li>Professional website</li>
		<li>Unique or good project</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Wait for it to cool down and build a bottom</li>
	<li>Wait for it to re-test the bottom at least once so we know there's support</li>
	<li>Buy! Then sell for profit a day or two later.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has the following advantages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The project is usually not a scam, as most shit tokens rugpull on the first day</li>
	<li>Many pesalers have already sold because they dumped on everyone</li>
	<li>You had enough time to research the project and decide for yourself if its good</li>
	<li>If the support holds, you are unlikely to lose a lot of money very quickly</li>
	<li>Maybe manye other people wait to to buy the bottom and a bottom can be the beginning of an upwards trend</li>
	<li>If you buy a token right when its floating around somewhere, hoping it will go up, there is a good chance it will dump within a few hours and you'll have lost all your money if it doesn't go up again :). And even if it does go up again: You don't know if it really will. And it's a really bad feeling to see your money go to 0. So why not minimize the risk and maximize your chances buy buying a good legit project when its low and has kind of "proven" itself already.</li>
</ol>

	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $5273</p>
	<p><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> went up more, I sold a little more:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 14.42.41.png"/>
	<p>I bought for 1585$ and so far I sold for 2845$. I always sold a little when it just went up a lot, amounting to 2845$ in total. And I still have a third of the $BEZOS left that I bought which is currently worth 1665$.</p>
	<p>So I have more than doubled that investment!</p>
	<p>$KEKBGS is still around the same, I have a slight plus there if I would sell now.</p>
	<p><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> doesn't do much, it is down around 20 or 30% from when I bought. I thought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> would aggressively bounce back up like it always did before, but that didn't happen. Also I bought at around the support level but it went down further than the support.</p>
	<p>Now I bought a little bit of <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> at $0.0004244 but just for 291$:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 14.53.51.png">
	<p>And I bought more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> for like 0.4eth which is like 1300$ at $0.003092.</p>
	<p>This is where I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> now:</p>
	<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 15.07.50.png">
	<p>I think <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> is a great project but its marketcap is 8.3M$ and its ATH is a 5x away.</p>
	<p>But <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a>'s ATH is a 6x away and its marketcap is only 304K$. So <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> may have slightly more potential.</p>
	<p>Maybe I will buy more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> when it goes down a little more. But on the other hand I think its better to not have all of your money in trades.</p>
	<p>When I think about it, it would be good if I would trade in a way where I make sure my eth or usdt always grows.</p>
	<p>Meaning I think it would be great if I would trade, then put some of the earnings aside and not touch them everytime I win some money. This way I'm less likely to loose a lot of money and would work my way up slowly.</p>
	<p>And I just bought some <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x3f36ba4ecfefcab2d4da427d07b0f604871863a1">$BRETT2.0</a> for 300$ which came out 1 hour ago. Because <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xba3f945812a83471d709bce9c3ca699a19fb46f7">$BRETT</a> got so popular and 77xt, maybe $BRETT2.0 will go well too.</p>
	<p>And so far it doesn't look like a scam.</p>

	<strong>6th of April 2024</strong>
	<p>$KEKBGS went up a little since I bought last time:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-06 at 07.38.45.png">
	<p>$BS4 has found a new low interestingly:</p>
	<p>I bought at $0.004749 and it went down to 0.002$ and then up again. Let's see.</p>

	<strong>5th of April 2024, evening</strong>
	<p>So i let <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> bake and its gone up quite well:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 20.54.40.png">
	<p>I bought the bottom where the arrow is at $0.0001093 for 1585$.</p>
	<p>Now it went up by 80% to $0.0001868 and I took some profit. I sold a third of my coins and got 966.72$. I still have two thirds of the coin in my wallet and will let it bake more.</p>
	<p>I hope it will still do a 2x or 3x! So I might sell tomorrow or tomorrow evening let's see.</p>
	<p>Now i bought some more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe052bbf8e89e20ce2f7f2f52ab4b6e6e1fb25011">$KEK</a> for 0.1 eth (around 300$), cause there was a good dip and i believe in the project:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.09.18.png">
	<p>A little update on <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a>: It went down quite a lot more than I thought it would!</p>
	<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.40.21.png">
	<p>This new low would have been a great entry!</p>
	<p>I do think this is good enough, so I just bought it!</p>
	<p>This is my entry:</p>
	<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.49.41.png">
	<p>I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> for around 0.2eth (637.33$) at $0.004749.</p>
	<p>Let's see how this goes.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<strong>5th of April, 2024</strong>
	<p>So I woke up and the <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> coin is doing well.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.22.53.png">
	<p>I bought the bottom at around 0.0001$ and now its at 0.00018$, so it already went up by 80%.</p>
	<p>I will let this coin bake for another day or two and see how it goes.</p>

	<p>Another coin that is interesting is still <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> It has dumped a lot since yesterday:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.26.30.png">
	<p>The support could probably be ascending, so the next low could very well be here:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.30.18.png">
	<p>I set an alert for when to coin goes below 0.006 and 0.005.</p>

	<p>Let's look at <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448">$FUNGI</a>. Interestingly, it hasn't dumped yet! Yesterday it went up from 0.016$ to 0.09$, now its at 0.07$.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.35.24.png">
	<p>I also bought this token 2 days ago: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe052bbf8e89e20ce2f7f2f52ab4b6e6e1fb25011?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">$KEKBGS</a>. I found it on some random telegram chat.</p>
	<p>The coin exists since 5 days. I was impatient with my entry and just bought a top :D.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.42.19.png">
	<p>This coin seems pretty healthy and not scammy. It has a good rating and the graph doesn't look like a fast pump and dump but rather like a slowly climbing graph. Let's see how it does.</p>
	<p>Maybe <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> would have been a good trade too!</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.47.19.png">
	<p>After $DINO found support at the first arrow, we could have bought at the second arrow.</p>
	<p>The description of the $DINO token sounds good: <i>"Introducing $DINO 🦖, first MEME coin built on ERC-50 protocol. A protocol with 'NO RUG' guarantee! 🚫
All tokens transferred are immediately locked in LP 100% post minting. Say goodbye to rug pulls and hello to fairness and security!"</i></p>
<p>These are all the tokens I have on my watchlist and I will look for good oppurtunities here:</p>
<img loading="lazy" class="w-400" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.53.21.png">
<p>And this one too maybe: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x82ad659c2f152aad59bb37cbc5e7663a2de0c607">$BRIUN</a>.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<strong>4th of April, 2024</strong>
<p>Take a look at this token $FUNGI: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448</a></p>
<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.22.52.png">
<p>If we had bought the bottom here at 0.015$ and waited for one day, we would have 6xt, because the price went up to 0.09$</p>
<p>Actually I did buy the bottom on this one but paper-handed it and sold it half an hour later :)</p>
<p>Many tokens never recover as they are absolutey crap shit ones.</p>
<p>But this one is different. On their <a href="https://fungifungi.art/">website</a> you can see its actually an art project. It seems to be quite a good project!</p>
<p>The Defi scanner score doesn't look too good: <a href="https://de.fi/scanner/contract/0x7d9ce55d54ff3feddb611fc63ff63ec01f26d15f?chainId=base">score 54</a> but on dexscreener it looks alright:</p>
 <img loading="lazy" class="w-400" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.34.52.png">
	<p>As you can see, this coin has bounced back from its bottom very well already before (first arrow). That was a good indicator for a purchase when we got to the second low (second arrow/triangle).</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.35.53.png">
	<p>So now I set my alert to let me know when it goes below 0.16 again and will definitely buy it once it reaches that low.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>Lets look at the next token $BS4: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50</a></p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 00.01.28.png">
	<p>See how it hit a low 3 times already and bounced back up?</p>
	<p>I too bought this token on the third low. I should have held, but I paper handed this too because I'm an idiot. I sold half an our after I bought this :).</p>
	<p>It went from that bottom at 0.005 to 0.02 which is actually a 4x.</p>
	<p>See how the trading strategy would have worked well here?</p>
	<p>Its a pretty good project, I mean look at the website, they basically re-did the PS4 interface: <a href="https://www.basestation4.xyz/">https://www.basestation4.xyz/</a>.</p>
	<p>Right now it seems to be dumping again.</p>
	<p>I will definitely buy this one once it hits its low/support again at 0.005$. I set an alert.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>My call right now that I'm invested in is $BEZOS: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2</a></p>
	<p>This one costs 0.0001$ right now and its ATH was 0.001$. That is a 10x if it goes back up there.</p>
	<p>At the moment there is not much volume going on here.</p>
	<p>But it has bounced back once already a little from its support:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 00.27.12.png"/>
	<p>And I believe once the price goes up a little more, more people will pick up on the opportunity. The defi scanner score looks okay: <a href="https://de.fi/scanner/contract/0xf6fb8faad79b315137eab86053e24dc92caf57f8?chainId=base">69</a>.</p>
	<p>And their website is quite good. It has its own game, its own song and is really professional. <a href="https://buff.international/">https://buff.international/</a></p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>Let's look at this token.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 01.08.42.png">
	<p>I think this might not be a good investment yet. Because I think this token is still looking for its bottom.</p>
	<p>It hasn't bounced back yet in a convinving way.</p>
	<p>This is the token: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xb08a99ab559e5456907278727a3b0d968c0a313b">https://dexscreener.com/base/0xb08a99ab559e5456907278727a3b0d968c0a313b</a>. It could be a good investment once we see good indicators forming.</p>
