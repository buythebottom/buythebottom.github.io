<h1>Buy the Bottom</h1>

<p>My Trading Blog on the Base Chain.</p>


<h2>The Premise & Strategy:</h2>

<p>Here's the theory. People who make good money who trade volatile cryptocurrencies short-term either buy once a token comes out or they buy the bottom of a good token that bounces back up.</p>
<p>Since 99% of coins are scams on base, it's hard to find a good project and be early.</p>
<p>Also, once a token is released, you can't get its information on <a href="https://de.fi/scanner/">https://de.fi/scanner/</a> to see if its legit, only after like 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Probably <a href="https://tokensniffer.com/">tokensniffer.com</a> works though.</p>
<p>So if you buy a coin once it comes out, you may realize you can't sell it, because they coded the token in a way where only whitelisted addresses are allowed to sell.</p>
<p>Or you get rugpulled.</p>
<p>Or if the token is legit, the presalers dump on you once the price rises on the first day.</p>
<p>All of this is BS!</p>
<p>That's why we go for a different strategy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Find a good legit token:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Good score on de.fi/scanner and good rating on dexscreener</li>
		<li>Professional website</li>
		<li>Unique or good project</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Wait for it to cool down and build a bottom</li>
	<li>Wait for it to re-test the bottom at least once so we know there's support</li>
	<li>Buy! Then sell for profit a day or two later. Edit: maybe it can take weeks :D</li>
</ol>
<p>This has the following advantages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The project is usually not a scam, as most shit tokens rugpull on the first day</li>
	<li>Many pesalers have already sold because they dumped on everyone</li>
	<li>You had enough time to research the project and decide for yourself if its good</li>
	<li>If the support holds, you are unlikely to lose a lot of money very quickly</li>
	<li>Maybe many other people wait to to buy the bottom and a bottom can be the beginning of an upwards trend</li>
	<li>If you buy a token right when its floating around somewhere, hoping it will go up, there is a good chance it will dump within a few hours and you'll have lost all your money if it doesn't go up again :). And even if it does go up again: You don't know if it really will. And it's a really bad feeling to see your money go to 0. So why not minimize the risk and maximize your chances by buying a good legit project when its low and has kind of "proven" itself already.</li>
</ol>

		<strong>Current WoW: 530$</strong>
		<p>Still waiting for it to go up more.</p>
		<p>So I think it would be best to create my own meme token on base and code/plan it in a way so:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I have someone who does raids?</li>
			<li>I have a mod?</li>
			<li>I get 1% per buy and sale</li>
			<li>Nobody has any presale tokens</li>
			<li>I don't own any tokens</li>
			<li>There is a mechanism that stops snipers from buying when the coin launches</li>
			<li>There is a mechanism that incentivizes people to post about it and shill it</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Btw I think this chart looks interesting:</p>

		<p>So I bought some more $RENT. Its still at its bottom and not much has happened there.</p>
		<p>I own 14.294 $RENT. If it goes up to its last ATH it will be worth 6100$. Let's see.</p>

		<article>
		<strong>12th of April</strong>
		<p>Current WoW: 1000$</p>
		<p>Yesterday I was up to 4000$. Then I invested into a scam coin and got rugged…</p>
		<p>Thing is, I'm not sticking to my strategy, I'm inpatient and I thought I could just buy projects that just came out and make a quick buck.</p>
		<p>The rush of buying something new and seeing it shoot up and go down and up again is just intoxicating. But I guess its the wrong way to go, I need patience.</p>
		<p>But since scam coins are so common, this is just a bad idea…</p>
		<p>I mean the coin I bought and got rugged on was so convincing. It seemed like they even coded a working product / game for it. mmh</p>
		<p>I thought this one looked interesting: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xbeef35a63fc62a3334630d9d3b4db27093d95317">$AIINU</a>.</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11.39.42.png"/>
		<p>It bottomed out and then shot through the roof. That's what I'm going for.</p>
		<p>I also bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x5a19556180ed8f4ea4ce390b426467b496d697fe">this coin</a> yesterday. Then I sold. And then it 10xd…</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11.46.56.png"/>
		<p>The coin's name is $RENT and it is a real game. I think the coin might shoot up again like this! I think I should probably buy this one instead of holding $BS4. Hmmmm. But I should wait for it to go down more.</p>
		<p>This is $BS4 right now:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11.43.36.png"/>
		<p>Sure, its low, but maybe its not a good entry, cause it could go even lower. Hmm.</p>
		<p>You know I think my strategy is good, problem is just I've been an idiot and didn't follow it.</p>
		<p>Let's see. If i fuck it up now, that's it. Cause there's only a thousand dollars left.</p>
		<p>One more thing I noticed is when projects shoot up again from their bottom, their price is often at an all time low, the volume too. Hmmm</p>

		<p>Also maybe another good way of doing this is look for projects that have mooned, bottomed, then mooned again, then bottomed again.</p>
		<p>Then we can guess the'yre going to moon again.</p>
		<p>So for example maybe i should buy $RENT and maybe I should buy $BEZOS once bezos is down in the dumps again.</p>
		<p>My goal is 20k $. xD</p>
		<p>This token <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x7bc7d459444847ed0f187b1866cc7d02943d178f">$ACAB</a> looks interesting now cause it has a very nice flat bottom:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 18.37.20.png">
		<p>Look at $RENT now:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 18.40.26.png">
		<p>I now DCA'd my entries. I could have been more patient and bought in lower.</p>

		<strong>11th of April</strong>
		<p>Current WoW: 2703$</p>
		<p>So, yesterday I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xb661303715c4b7eb010a7f123034f671dd8373b1">this</a> and then sold for a loss. Then it went back up…</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 08.46.22.png">
		<p>Maybe I should have bought here, instead of buying the end of a falling knife, cause even if afterwards it went back up again, it still was in a downtrend.</p>
		<p>So, I should have bought here (you can also see the double bottom / double tap here):</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09.12.44.png"/>
		<p>And I managed to buy <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x7bc7d459444847ed0f187b1866cc7d02943d178f?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">this coin</a> super early, but then I sold it too early after if 4xt. I bought for a 100$.</p>
		<p>Look:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09.00.56.png"/>
		<p>If I had held, until now, those 100$ would have been 2215$.</p>
		<p>I found this token on photon. It seems that on <a href="https://photon-base.tinyastro.io/en/discover">Photon</a> you can really see base tokens when they come out. On dexscreener, they have to pay for the token to show up there. So, dexscreener will always be late. I didn't know that before.</p>

		<p>And also $BS4 went down a lot. Maybe this guy from the video meant a strong bottom is just a very low bottom. Maybe my bottom here on $BS4 just wasn't low enough for me to buy in.</p>

		<p>I mean look at the bottom that I bought in for $BEZOS:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 08.56.53.png"/>
		<p>That bottom was really low.</p>
		<p>Now look at the $BS4 bottom that I bought in at:</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 08.59.08.png"/>
		<p>I bought in at where the blue line is. Maybe that just wasn't low enough.</p>

		<p>Also yesterday I bought this <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x14c0bef6878d4fb4efa9fc2b656aff27218290c7?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">token</a></p>
		<p>I just bought for a hundred dollars right at the beginning. But then it 10xed.</p>
		<p>Instead of selling, I held, but then the dev just sold all of this tokens and the coin went back to almost 0… And the dev left the telegram chat.</p>
		<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09.06.44.png">

		<p>In both of these cases, I could have just sold like 20% of the coin. And then I would have seen what happens.</p>
		<p>In one case, the coin dumped and then at least I would have gotten back my initial investment, because I had sold 20%.</p>
		<p>In the other case, after selling 20%, I would have seen the coin goes up more, ok I would have sold another 20% and so on, and I would have made more money than what I had made now.</p>

		<p>Idk man its kind of disheartening, you just get rekt so quickly and this space is full of scammers and people who make coins and then just sell their coins on you (the devs). So for a beginner you can really loose money fast.</p>
		<p>I wonder if I just need more practice or if in general this is just a loosing game like going to a casino.</p>
		<p>I want to try out more of buying a coin really early.</p>
		<p>But for now, I will wait for $BS4 to go up and I have to work on my normal job instead of looking at charts all day.</p>
		<p>Because just looking at charts is kind of dumb, and it also really stresses you out.</p>

	<strong>10th of April 2024</strong>
	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $4900 🤑</p>
	<p>Yesterday the $WIFE token had doubled in the morning. I should have sold, from then on it only went dowhnill, with almost no volume other than a few sales.</p>
	<p>So then I sold $WIFE, because I didn't want to lose money on it. Also the developer seemed to be really bad at marketing.</p>
	<p>I also sold my $KEKBGS token, because not much happened there. I might buy some of them later on again.</p>
	<p>With these two, I haven't really lost much nor made much.</p>
	<p>I watched this video by a guy who trades on the base chain: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnGrCwrntM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnGrCwrntM</a>.</p>
	<p>He says to avoid trading on a downward trend and avoid trading on a "falling knife".</p>
	<p>Basically, he said to watch out for coins with a lot of volume that just came out that do a double bottom.</p>
	<p>I can see that he is right, the tokens $BS4 and $FUNGI have some double bottoms that lead to big rises. Also he said to trade coins within the first day, cause that's where we have the most volume.</p>
	<p>I had sold all of my $BEZOS already. But to my surprise, it went up even more as u can see here:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 07.40.54.png">
	<p>If I had held, I would have 9xt.</p>
	<p>Yesterday I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe0b5a3c0540d085533e9a922e3ac92869cdc4f95?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">$CORGI</a>, it just had dropped from its ATH on its first day. Same with <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xcb38b9dbda1982b6948e239e8f477633a08c6201?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">$JPM</a> which I bought too.</p>
	<p>$CORGI:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 07.46.00.png"/>
	<p>$JPM:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 07.47.25.png"/>

	<p>So now it seems like I have 2 strategies in my arsenal:</p>
	<p>First one by <a href="https://youtu.be/KFx-Ji2kHoY?si=xGQe3LVkMqGu2P76">this guy</a> who says buy a strong bottom of a token who has a very active community. This one would be $BS4 in my wallet.</p>
	<p>Second strategy by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnGrCwrntM">this guy</a> who says buy a "double tap" (double bottom) preferably on the first day a coin launches.</p>
	<p>I think for the second strategy, I need to sort by volume and show coins less than 24 hours old. My filter should be this: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/new-pairs?rankBy=volume&order=desc&chainIds=base&minLiq=1000&maxAge=24">https://dexscreener.com/new-pairs?rankBy=volume&order=desc&chainIds=base&minLiq=1000&maxAge=24</a>. Then of course check the coin with tokensniffer.com.</p>
	<p>List of today's new tokens that seem legit: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x176567c44342edda7aae629f7cecab246f22f69a">bonk</a>, <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xd95bae63641d822dc591bd4aca7a64e53eac76f9">chomp</a>, <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x4ff7247b6badc58bd40ea9f587515adb6e8878a0">blu bull</a></p>

	<p>Actually by <a href="https://dexscreener.com/new-pairs?rankBy=volume&order=desc&chainIds=base&minLiq=1000&maxAge=1">sorting by age less than one hour and sorting by volume</a> i found this one and bought it: Toshi Bald. It has a 100 score on tokensniffer and I got it 25 minute after release. Edit: On dexscreener itself there were like 2 or 3 red flags, should have factored that in too…</p>
	<p>Maybe this is the first time I'm really early on a really good legit project.</p>
	<p>I sold my JP Morgan coin to buy this one.</p>

	<p>Actually, just after buying it just now, it already 2xt:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 08.38.18.png">
	<p>And now, suddenly, after it has 2xt, the score on tokensniffer says it is only 45 instead of 100 :D. It just said score 100 just a few minutes earlier!</p>
	<p>Shit, this was a rugpull, but it looked so legit! :| Nice, another 500$ lost. I couldn't sell it anymore.</p>
	<p>Anyways, <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x176567c44342edda7aae629f7cecab246f22f69a">$BONK</a> looks like a legit and promising project. And it just launched 9 hours ago so I sold my $CORGI and bought a dip.</p>
	<p>Edit: I think I just can't handle the pressure. I sold $BONK again. Right before it went up a lot and almost 2xed lmao:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 11.17.35.png">
	<p>I guess i just can't handle the pressure, especially knowing that oftentimes just after one day most tokens dump so hard!</p>
	<p>I took that money and bought $BS4 for it, staying true to my original strategy.</p>
	<p>I mean, $BS4 has a strong bottom and I can go to sleep at night knowing that I probably won't have lost all of my money when I wake up the next day:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 11.49.03.png">
	<p>And I can just go about my business, knowing that I'll probably not lose all of my funds within the next few hours :). That's whats so good about buying the bottom of a strong project. I don't feel like daytrading, I have a job and a life. And it just makes me way too nervous.</p>
	<p>I mean, $BONK could be a good hold for a long time, like $BRETT. I might just wait for another dip and only buy for like a hundred dollars. I'm just way too burned by all of the dumps and scams.</p>
	<p>And I feel like holding. Looking at charts, finding new tokens. This can become an obsession and I really need to work on my job and go to the gym and take good care of myself instead of looking at charts all day and trading.</p>
	<p>I just want to hold one or two or three good projects that I believe in and sell when there is a massive pump and that's it.</p>
	<p>For now I will research less and focus more on my work and just wait for $BS4 to pump.</p>

	<p>So I just watched this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/KFx-Ji2kHoY?si=xGQe3LVkMqGu2P76">https://youtu.be/KFx-Ji2kHoY?si=xGQe3LVkMqGu2P76</a>.</p>
	<p>Its pretty interesting, it says I can buy coins on <a href="https://pump.fun/">https://pump.fun</a> before they launch.</p>

	<strong>9th of April 2024</strong>
	<p>So I just watched this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/-dApKj4SdOA?si=NKZfNeA64wxU3k5b">https://youtu.be/-dApKj4SdOA?si=NKZfNeA64wxU3k5b</a>.</p>
	<p>His videos are really good and educational.</p>
	<p>He says to wait for after launch, see if the project has a strong bottom and active community on telegram.</p>
	<p>Then buy and wait.</p>
	<p>So, for example he bought <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x90c1b108ec75070a503784e44582a1cc0124956f?t=1712667339025">this coin</a> when it had a strong bottom:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 09.53.53.png"/>
	<p>Then he waited some weeks and then it mooned. He says these coins are the easiest money and most comfortable holds.</p>
	<p>Wallet distribution: Also, there shouldn't be lots of holders who all hold the same values like: 1.6%, 1.6%, 1.6%… because these are presalers who will dump on you.</p>
	<p>On really big green candles on the first few days, when a coin like 6xt for example, I should always sell 25% at least.</p>
	<p>He says don't swing trade.</p>

	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $5000 🤑</p>
	<p>Alright so I might regret this but I actually bought a coin that just came out and it looks legit and I got a good entry:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 07.30.12.png">
	<p>It is called "Based Tradwife" <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x19cd5789ae742bd5be37ae00ed73e8ece7b98fea">$WIFE</a></p>
	<p>So far $WIFE has 2xt since I bought, I didn't take profit yet because I want to see how far this goes.</p>
	<p>I'm still waiting for $BS4 to break out. The community behind it is strong on Telegram and the admin said he wants to create a game like Flappy Bird.</p>
	<p>This is the $BS4 graph:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 07.46.39.png"/>
	<p>$DINO just went down a litte.</p>
	<p>Well I guess I'll just need to wait now.</p>
	<p>Another strategy I had been thinking about was finding top traders on dexscreener:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 07.51.09.png"/>
	<p>And then putting their wallet address into this app called "<a href="https://zerion.io/">Zerion</a>". The app can track wallets and lets me know when they bought something.</p>
	<p>Also, another great thing to do would be to get in on presales MAYBE on <a href="https://www.pinksale.finance/">Pinksale</a>. But on this video, this guy says I should avoid presales: <a href="https://youtu.be/LAxIikB5giU?si=KQdo-GJt5qGDvlFU">here</a>. He says meme coins shouldn't get presales.</p>

	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $4769 🤑</p>
	<p>Imagine I hadn't bought BRETT2.0. Then my WoW would be +900$, it would be 5669$.</p>
	<p>I think it would be better if I would always send my ETH that I earned to binance and put it into Wormhole:</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/trade/W_USDT">Wormhole on Binance</a>, <a href="https://wormhole.com/">wormhole.com</a></p>
	<p>Or I should just follow my own rules better.</p>
	<p>Brett 2.0 just bottoms out it doesn't find any support :D.<br/>
	Oh and I sold my last bit of $BEZOS yesterday. This was a really successful trade.</p>
	<p>I hope my wallet will be >5k again soon.</p>

	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $4524 🤑</p>
	<p>This seems to a be a good place to find legit tokens on base: <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/explore/base">https://app.uniswap.org/explore/base</a>.</p>
	<p>$KEKBGS went down a little, $BEZOS went up a little more and $BS4 is going up a little and I'm waiting for $DINO to go up a little.</p>
	<p>I think $BS4 will work well and go up, it is my biggest position.</p>
	<p>I bought it at $0.004749 and at $0.003092 and now its at $0.004201 so it went up quite well already since last time I bought.</p>
	<p>So, yesterday after I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x3f36ba4ecfefcab2d4da427d07b0f604871863a1">$BRETT2.0</a> it dumped. So then I bought some more:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 08.50.25.png">
	<p>It seems that I spent 951$ in total for $BRETT2.0. I thought I had bought like for 500$ max, I think 951$ was too much.</p>
	<p>Also maybe I should have waited for the dump, well you never know right. All of this really was a very high-risk play, cause I'm really not sure if this is a scam or not.</p>
	<p>And it goes against the rules & strategy that I wanted to go for a little bit.</p>
	<p>I mean I'm not sure if it was a dump, or if the coin is a scam. The score looks pretty good though: Score 97: <a href="https://tokensniffer.com/token/base/0zf0kjoc9dsabz8azb9jnl2s2i9snpqf2uixqjdxlzgkxs4cvq36v4k049p6">token sniffer</a>.</p>
	<p>Let's see, maybe it will take some time to take off.</p>
	<p>I mean $PEPE went so well and then <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-2-0/">$PEPE2.0</a> mooned as well.</p>
	<p>So lets see how $BS4 goes, this will make me a lot of money if this goes well. I hope it at least 2xes.</p>

	<strong>7th of April 2024</strong>
	<p>Current WoW (worth of wallet): $5273 🤑</p>
	<p><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> went up more, I sold a little more:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 14.42.41.png"/>
	<p>I bought for 1585$ and so far I sold for 2845$. I always sold a little when it just went up a lot, amounting to 2845$ in total. And I still have a third of the $BEZOS left that I bought which is currently worth 1665$.</p>
	<p>So I have more than doubled that investment!</p>
	<p>$KEKBGS is still around the same, I have a slight plus there if I would sell now.</p>
	<p><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> doesn't do much, it is down around 20 or 30% from when I bought. I thought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> would aggressively bounce back up like it always did before, but that didn't happen. Also I bought at around the support level but it went down further than the support.</p>
	<p>Now I bought a little bit of <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> at $0.0004244 but just for 291$:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 14.53.51.png">
	<p>And I bought more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> for like 0.4eth which is like 1300$ at $0.003092.</p>
	<p>This is where I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> now:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 15.07.50.png">
	<p>I think <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> is a great project but its marketcap is 8.3M$ and its ATH is a 5x away.</p>
	<p>But <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a>'s ATH is a 6x away and its marketcap is only 304K$. So <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> may have slightly more potential.</p>
	<p>Maybe I will buy more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> when it goes down a little more. But on the other hand I think its better to not have all of your money in trades.</p>
	<p>When I think about it, it would be good if I would trade in a way where I make sure my eth or usdt always grows.</p>
	<p>Meaning I think it would be great if I would trade, then put some of the earnings aside and not touch them everytime I win some money. This way I'm less likely to loose a lot of money and would work my way up slowly.</p>
	<p>And I just bought some <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x3f36ba4ecfefcab2d4da427d07b0f604871863a1">$BRETT2.0</a> for 300$ which came out 1 hour ago. Because <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xba3f945812a83471d709bce9c3ca699a19fb46f7">$BRETT</a> got so popular and 77xt, maybe $BRETT2.0 will go well too.</p>
	<p>And so far it doesn't look like a scam.</p>

	<p>$KEKBGS went up a little since I bought last time:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-06 at 07.38.45.png">
	<p>$BS4 has found a new low interestingly:</p>
	<p>I bought at $0.004749 and it went down to 0.002$ and then up again. Let's see.</p>

	<strong>5th of April 2024, evening</strong>
	<p>So i let <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> bake and its gone up quite well:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 20.54.40.png">
	<p>I bought the bottom where the arrow is at $0.0001093 for 1585$.</p>
	<p>Now it went up by 80% to $0.0001868 and I took some profit. I sold a third of my coins and got 966.72$. I still have two thirds of the coin in my wallet and will let it bake more.</p>
	<p>I hope it will still do a 2x or 3x! So I might sell tomorrow or tomorrow evening let's see.</p>
	<p>Now i bought some more <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe052bbf8e89e20ce2f7f2f52ab4b6e6e1fb25011">$KEK</a> for 0.1 eth (around 300$), cause there was a good dip and i believe in the project:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.09.18.png">
	<p>A little update on <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a>: It went down quite a lot more than I thought it would!</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.40.21.png">
	<p>This new low would have been a great entry!</p>
	<p>I do think this is good enough, so I just bought it!</p>
	<p>This is my entry:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 21.49.41.png">
	<p>I bought <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> for around 0.2eth (637.33$) at $0.004749.</p>
	<p>Let's see how this goes.</p>

<article>
	<strong>5th of April, 2024</strong>
	<p>So I woke up and the <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">$BEZOS</a> coin is doing well.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.22.53.png">
	<p>I bought the bottom at around 0.0001$ and now its at 0.00018$, so it already went up by 80%.</p>
	<p>I will let this coin bake for another day or two and see how it goes.</p>

	<p>Another coin that is interesting is still <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">$BS4</a> It has dumped a lot since yesterday:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.26.30.png">
	<p>The support could probably be ascending, so the next low could very well be here:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.30.18.png">
	<p>I set an alert for when to coin goes below 0.006 and 0.005.</p>

	<p>Let's look at <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448">$FUNGI</a>. Interestingly, it hasn't dumped yet! Yesterday it went up from 0.016$ to 0.09$, now its at 0.07$.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.35.24.png">
	<p>I also bought this token 2 days ago: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe052bbf8e89e20ce2f7f2f52ab4b6e6e1fb25011?maker=0x09bdd8a84E49a79E0B918BDcF90C91Cd4EF2664C">$KEKBGS</a>. I found it on some random telegram chat.</p>
	<p>The coin exists since 5 days. I was impatient with my entry and just bought a top :D.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.42.19.png">
	<p>This coin seems pretty healthy and not scammy. It has a good rating and the graph doesn't look like a fast pump and dump but rather like a slowly climbing graph. Let's see how it does.</p>
	<p>Maybe <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x6a77cdec82eff6a6a5d273f18c1c27cd3d71a588">$DINO</a> would have been a good trade too!</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.47.19.png">
	<p>After $DINO found support at the first arrow, we could have bought at the second arrow.</p>
	<p>The description of the $DINO token sounds good: <i>"Introducing $DINO 🦖, first MEME coin built on ERC-50 protocol. A protocol with 'NO RUG' guarantee! 🚫
All tokens transferred are immediately locked in LP 100% post minting. Say goodbye to rug pulls and hello to fairness and security!"</i></p>
<p>These are all the tokens I have on my watchlist and I will look for good oppurtunities here:</p>
<img loading="lazy" class="w-400" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 09.53.21.png">
<p>And this one too maybe: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x82ad659c2f152aad59bb37cbc5e7663a2de0c607">$BRIUN</a>.</p>

	<strong>4th of April, 2024</strong>
<p>Take a look at this token $FUNGI: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x8ce9b689018fc94f44540b62ba6e10dc8b346448</a></p>
<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.22.52.png">
<p>If we had bought the bottom here at 0.015$ and waited for one day, we would have 6xt, because the price went up to 0.09$</p>
<p>Actually I did buy the bottom on this one but paper-handed it and sold it half an hour later :)</p>
<p>Many tokens never recover as they are absolutey crap shit ones.</p>
<p>But this one is different. On their <a href="https://fungifungi.art/">website</a> you can see its actually an art project. It seems to be quite a good project!</p>
<p>The Defi scanner score doesn't look too good: <a href="https://de.fi/scanner/contract/0x7d9ce55d54ff3feddb611fc63ff63ec01f26d15f?chainId=base">score 54</a> but on dexscreener it looks alright:</p>
 <img loading="lazy" class="w-400" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.34.52.png">
	<p>As you can see, this coin has bounced back from its bottom very well already before (first arrow). That was a good indicator for a purchase when we got to the second low (second arrow/triangle).</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 23.35.53.png">
	<p>So now I set my alert to let me know when it goes below 0.16 again and will definitely buy it once it reaches that low.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>Lets look at the next token $BS4: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x0090d9b730e03da3b1977a4b49f64d93a878cb50</a></p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 00.01.28.png">
	<p>See how it hit a low 3 times already and bounced back up?</p>
	<p>I too bought this token on the third low. I should have held, but I paper handed this too because I'm an idiot. I sold half an our after I bought this :).</p>
	<p>It went from that bottom at 0.005 to 0.02 which is actually a 4x.</p>
	<p>See how the trading strategy would have worked well here?</p>
	<p>Its a pretty good project, I mean look at the website, they basically re-did the PS4 interface: <a href="https://www.basestation4.xyz/">https://www.basestation4.xyz/</a>.</p>
	<p>Right now it seems to be dumping again.</p>
	<p>I will definitely buy this one once it hits its low/support again at 0.005$. I set an alert.</p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>My call right now that I'm invested in is $BEZOS: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2">https://dexscreener.com/base/0x21c1e3c55b8398e2b58d86ce682dd664a381eca2</a></p>
	<p>This one costs 0.0001$ right now and its ATH was 0.001$. That is a 10x if it goes back up there.</p>
	<p>At the moment there is not much volume going on here.</p>
	<p>But it has bounced back once already a little from its support:</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 00.27.12.png"/>
	<p>And I believe once the price goes up a little more, more people will pick up on the opportunity. The defi scanner score looks okay: <a href="https://de.fi/scanner/contract/0xf6fb8faad79b315137eab86053e24dc92caf57f8?chainId=base">69</a>.</p>
	<p>And their website is quite good. It has its own game, its own song and is really professional. <a href="https://buff.international/">https://buff.international/</a></p>
</article>

<article>
	<p>Let's look at this token.</p>
	<img loading="lazy" src="Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 01.08.42.png">
	<p>I think this might not be a good investment yet. Because I think this token is still looking for its bottom.</p>
	<p>It hasn't bounced back yet in a convinving way.</p>
	<p>This is the token: <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xb08a99ab559e5456907278727a3b0d968c0a313b">https://dexscreener.com/base/0xb08a99ab559e5456907278727a3b0d968c0a313b</a>. It could be a good investment once we see good indicators forming.</p>
